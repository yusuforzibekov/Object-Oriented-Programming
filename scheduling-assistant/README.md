# Scheduling assistant

## Description

Implement [SchedulingAssistant](src/main/java/com/epam/rd/autotasks/timing/SchedulingAssistant.java) methods.

Scheduling Assistant helps to schedule team meetings.
A Team is a collection of Developers who live in a particular city.
Cities are across the world and time zones, so it may be hard to plan a meeting that everyone can attend.

So, Scheduling Assistant tries to schedule a meeting considering the different time zones of developers and some preferences.
Preferences are basically a combination of what period is OK to set up a meeting (today, tomorrow, or this week) and what is a preferred part of the period: earliest or latest.
